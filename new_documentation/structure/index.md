# Structuring

## Pre-requisites
- It should be uniform and recognizable: a team member should immediately find his/her way without needing extra explanation

- It should not add overhead but limit it

- It should be extensible

- It should be reliable: if a certain type of information is not available in the expected location, this should mean it does not exist

- no spaces in folder or file names

- Avoid Broad And Redundant Folder Names


## Verification - how to verify that the structure is good
- If I'm a new member joining the team, how can I get started on a specific task for a particular application or solution?

- If I'm an end user, where can I find information on how to do something?

- If I'm a team member, where should I put information like analysis, diagrams, manuals, etc.

- If I'm management, where can I find information about the latest releases, upcoming features etc.?

- If I get a support case (eg. site is down), how can I quickly find all the information necessary to be able to assist?


## Success Criteria
- Matching all prerequisites

- Provide the answers to the verification questions

- Being able to convert all existing documentation into the new structure
