# Content Types
The content types needs to encompass all types of documentation used by IT. The categories below are examples.

Not all content has to live in Github and Docusaurus, IT processes could be placed in Microsoft Teams, compliance documents in Neupart, contracts in x.. etc. We should however keep reference documentation (index) so IT members only need to turn to a docusaurus site and search to find a solution/answer. This will truly help us implement the most efficient Service Desk (ITIL)

# Guidelines

## Docusaurus style guide
https://internal-docs.niscloud.com/docs/processes/releases/documentation/nordic/

## Required in all documents
- **Product name** - What product or service is the document written for

- **Version** - The latest version of the document

- **Last updated** - The date when the document was last updated

- **Author** - The writer or contributors 

- **Required Knowledge** (Pre-requisites) - What pre-existing knowledge is required to be able to understand and use the guidance provided.

- **Target Audience** - The business roles or audience the document is aimed at 

- **Purpose** - what are you trying to achieve, and not to achieve with this document. Scope and non-scope statements benefit not only the reader but also the writer. While writing, if the contents of your document drifts away from the purpose (or goes into the non-scope statement), then you must either refocus your document or modify your scope statement. When reviewing, delete any sections that don't help satisfy the scope statement.

- **Scope** - This document describes the design of the Github project; IT-Maintenance. This document does not describe the technical design for execution with Github

- **Table of Contents** - The overview of the content written in the document.


To ensure we have a uniform way of writing documentation, all guidelines written here should be reflected in the relevant  templates.
