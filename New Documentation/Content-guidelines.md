# Guidelines

## Required in all documents
- **Product name** - What product or service is the document written for

- **Version** - The latest version of the document

- **Last updated** - The date when the document was last updated

- **Author** - The writer or contributors 

- **Required Knowledge** (Pre-requisites) - What pre-existing knowledge is required to be able to understand and use the guidance provided.

- **Target Audience** - The business roles or audience the document is aimed at 

- **Purpose** - what are you trying to achieve, and not to achieve with this document. Scope and non-scope statements benefit not only the reader but also the writer. While writing, if the contents of your document drifts away from the purpose (or goes into the non-scope statement), then you must either refocus your document or modify your scope statement. When reviewing, delete any sections that don't help satisfy the scope statement.

- **Scope** - This document describes the design of the Github project; IT-Maintenance. This document does not describe the technical design for execution with Github

- **Table of Contents** - The overview of the content written in the document.


To ensure we have a uniform way of writing documentation, all guidelines written here should be reflected in the relevant  templates.
