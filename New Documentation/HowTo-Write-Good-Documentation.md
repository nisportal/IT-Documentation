# Writing good documentation

![GoodDoc](../src/Elements-of-user-documentation.jpg)

### Simple Language
When it comes to any form of technical writing, perhaps the most important thing is the simplicity of language.

This is especially true for documentation targeted at end-users, who don’t have much technical knowledge. 

There’s no room for jargon. Even the most advanced features should be broken down in the simplest way possible to effectively explain its functionality and how to get the most out of it.

### A Good Flow
The second most crucial element of all successful user documentation is having a logical flow (or outline, if you will).

The goal is to deliver a coherent experience to your users in a way that makes sense, by solving one problem at a time.

For instance, if you’re selling an enterprise software, you wouldn’t want to start with the advanced features right off the bat.

Instead, you’d want to start off by helping them get set up, break down the user interface, and then take them through the individual features and what they can accomplish with them.

### Use of Visuals
The best user documentation has visuals.

Visuals can help simplify a complicated process and make it easier to understand. To that end, in addition to written instructions of a process, it’s highly recommended that you also show the users how it’s down.

Examples of visuals can include illustrations, screenshots, GIFs, or even short tutorial videos.

### Accessibility
All the digital documentation should be accessible to everyone. This includes optimizing your content in a way that it shows up properly on both desktop and mobile devices, and can be communicated to users who are blind or deaf.

For example, if you have your user documentation on a website, you might want to include an option that allows visually-impaired users to listen to the instructions.

Similarly, for those with audio impairment, ensure that the written content is clearly visible. 

### More Resources
Finally, your user documentation should include additional resources that the user might find useful.

Any sort of link that leads to online help or contact details that get them in touch with a support team works.

These details should be included throughout the documentation, or towards the end of the document.
