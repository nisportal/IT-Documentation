# IT Documentation plan

[Microsoft Project](https://project.microsoft.com/NordicInsuranceSoftware.onmicrosoft.com/en-US#/taskgrid?projectId=779e2f8a-f11a-4c11-a563-01bc6506ff53)

## End Goal
Our end goal is to have a very well segmented documentation with a clear cut between content types, audience and scopes. A structure where we always know where to find relevent information - by searching for it on Docusaurus.

<br/>

## Mapping of existing resources
What’s currently out there?  Are there old, outdated versions that need to be deleted? Do a quick audit and find anything and everything.

<br/>

## Outline Topics and sub topics
What topics and subtopics will we be covering in our documentation? Think of this as a table of contents and try to list out every major section and subsection

<br/>

## Tools and management
What software, tools, will be used besides Github and Docusaurus to create and manage the documentation?

<br/>

## Ignoring irellevant Documentation
- This documentation is no longer relevant, or maybe even obsolete, could be be kept for reference for historical purposes (like meeting notes)

- This documentation is not yet relevant or is relevant right now but not tomorrow -> this is mostly things like project documentation (technical/functional analysis) and unfinished documents

- this documentation is relevant right now and will remain relevant unless some undefined change happens

The new structure should group content as much as possible, and the relevancy of the documentation that is relevent "today" should be immediately obvious.

<br/>

## Deadline and final delivery
When is it due and what format will it be in? Technical documentation is as much about structure and delivery as it is content. And knowing how the content will be presented before we start will tell us what we need and where to put your efforts.

# Concerns with the current documentation state
- even though the different applications, projects etc. many similarities, the documentation structures does not.

- where content was put often depends on who is creating it than on on what it is about

- The current situation makes it very difficult for a new team member to find the way around the documentation on his/her own. It also makes it more difficult to provide operational support by people less up-to-date about our systems

- A lot of information is outdated. Often due to the fact that is was project related and the project has long passed, but also because there is no way to effectively review existing documentation

- our current documentation is badly segmented. For example a single document contains part user documentation, part technical documentation and part infrastructure
